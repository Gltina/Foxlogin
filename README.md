This's a last release version,
But I can tell you how to run this project after installing required module.

Platform:
	python 3.5.2
Required module:
	Pillow
	BeautifulSoup4
	
You could download them by using 'pip install xxx' .

Then,We use the pyinstaller to package our project , 
which command is 'pyinstaller -F -w -c code_icon.ico Main.py' .
