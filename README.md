If you want to use the exe file.You can download it from "https://yunpan.cn/cMqRsqXNIIPVV (Code:1c96)"

This's a last release version,
But I can tell you how to run this project after installing required module.

Platform:
	python 3.5.2
Required module:
	Pillow
	BeautifulSoup4
	
You could download them by using 'pip install xxx' .

Then,We use the pyinstaller to package our project , 
which command is 'pyinstaller -Fw -D -i code_icon.ico Main.py' .
